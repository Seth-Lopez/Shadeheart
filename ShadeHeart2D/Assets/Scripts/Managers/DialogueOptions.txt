The weather is nice today isn't it?
Have you been to The Company? I hear they are recruiting ShadeWeilders.
I hate how the trash has built up by the ocean. It used to be so nice.
Have you seen chickens running around the city, someone should probably call animal control.

Have you seen the amount of trash that's being left behind? I've never seen it get so bad.
I've been trying to clean up the mess but it never ends.
If you see someone littering please report them to the police.

What's up man?
Are you a ShadeWeilder?
I don't like The Company, they have to be too good to be true. Don't tell them I said that.
**suspicious man**
Get out of here.
Leave me alone.
Scram.
Leave.
